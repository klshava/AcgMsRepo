# AcgMsRepo


Work with GitHub in Azure Data Factory
Azure Data Factory and Synapse Pipelines allow you to connect and configure a Git repository, where all the artifacts can be stored.
In this lab, we'll create a new source control repository in GitHub. We'll then configure GitHub with Azure Data Factory by defining collaboration and publish branches. 
Then, we'll see what changes can be committed to these branches, and how it generates an ARM template for deployment.
